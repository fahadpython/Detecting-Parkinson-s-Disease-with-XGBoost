# Detecting-Parkinson-s-Disease-with-XGBoost

## Project Description
This project aims to build a model using which we can accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in one’s body. The project uses scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost libraries. The dataset used in the project is present in `parkinsons.data`. The project loads the data, gets the features and labels, scales the features, then splits the dataset, builds an XGBClassifier, and then calculates the accuracy of the model.
